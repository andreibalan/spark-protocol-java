Spark Protocol Java
===================

Java module for hosting direct encrypted CoAP socket connections for Spark.IO Devices.

### What is this project?
This project will be a simple java library that handles communication for Spark.IO devices like the [Core](https://store.spark.io/?product=spark-core) and [Photon](https://store.spark.io/?product=spark-photon). 
It will reflect the original open-source protocol library from Spark that you can find [here](https://github.com/spark/spark-protocol). 

The original is written in NodeJS but my own personal project is written in Java and I want to have the Spark.IO devices fully integrated in my platform. I want to share with the world this library because I know that other people will prefer the Java version of the protocol.

### Will it be similar to the original?
Mostly it will remain the same but there will be some functionality for easily monitoring events and some of the classes may be named differently. I will provide the full documentation when this library will be ready.
For more details check out the official [Spark Open Source Page](http://spark.github.io/)

### When will it be ready?
I have proposed to get a fully working version by the start of April so stay tuned!
